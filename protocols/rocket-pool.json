  "description": "Rocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol that enables users to stake ETH without requiring the full 32 ETH validator threshold. It combines pooled staking with a trustless node operator network, allowing users to participate as stakers (via the liquid staking token rETH) or node operators (by running minipools).",
